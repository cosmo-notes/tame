    "[Enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) are biocatalysts. They bind to some molecules and accelerate some chemical reactions, turning a substrate (the molecule) into a product (another molecule) we might care (or not) about. The transition of this system goes a little like this:"

We have some initial amount $S(0)$ of the substrate in a liquid volume, and plan to introduce an initial amount $E(0)$ of the enzyme. Can we model the catalyzation dynamics and predict how the production $P(t)$ will depend on $E(0)$?"
