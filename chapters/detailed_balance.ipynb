    "We started the previous section by stating the obvious: Master equations are simply systems of differential equations and can therefore be solved by the usual techniques. However, there are many additional restrictions to master equations that allow us to define useful tools for their analysis. In particular, master equations track occupation numbers which represent a probability mass function. Therefore, the variables of this system of equations are always positive and must sum to one.\n",

We say that a system follows [detailed balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detailed_balance) when the input and output flows between each pairs of states balance each other (i.e., every transition is reversible and used as frequently in each direction). Mathematically, we can write"
